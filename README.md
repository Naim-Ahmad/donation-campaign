This is a donation campaign web site built using React.js. Below are some of its key features:

## Features

1. **Fully Responsive Design:** This means that the user interface of the platform is designed to work and look good on various devices and screen sizes, such as desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. It ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience for all users.

2. **Search by Donation Category:** Users can search for donations based on specific categories. If a result is found that matches the selected category, the platform will display the relevant donation information. If no results are found, it should inform the user that no data was found for that category.

3. **Single Donation per Package:** Users are restricted from making multiple donations for the same package. If a user tries to donate to the same package more than once, they will receive an alert or notification informing them of this restriction.

4. **Donation History Page**: After making a donation, users can view a list of all their previous donations on a dedicated donation history page. This allows users to track their donation activity and history.

5. **Pie Chart in Statistics Page:** The statistics page provides users with a visual representation, such as a pie chart, that displays their personal donation contributions compared to the total donations received. This chart helps users understand their impact and contribution relative to the overall donations.
